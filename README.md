A few useful commands
- `Set-GitHubUser` allows me to specify a specific account to use for different repos. When you are required to have a special github account for a specific job, it comes in handy.
- `Get-GitHubUser` is an extension to the former.
- `run++` is for quick and dirty c++ builds using clang
- `build++` is for building without running
- `ierl` is for registering the erlang jupyter kernel. I only used it once.
